# CRUD APP
I'm developing a CRUD app (Create, Read, Update and Delete) in shiny, that uses forms to get data into and out of a database.

## USAGE

- **Create the necessary tables** . You have the sql scripts in the data folder
- **Create a credentials file**. It must contain the following information:
  - user
  - password
  - host
  - port
- **Run the CRUD_app_shiny.R**. The credentials.R and the CRUD_app_shiny.R files must be in the same folder. 

## ROADMAP
- Include the update and delete operations
